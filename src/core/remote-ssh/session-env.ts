// Argv-free env delivery for REMOTE agent sessions.
//
// The problem this solves: a remote node's gateway/custom env used to ride the ssh command as
// tmux `-e KEY=VALUE` pairs — parking the gateway API key on the LOCAL ssh client's argv for the
// whole session (world-readable /proc/<pid>/cmdline on a multi-user host, the PR #195 leak
// class) and on the remote process table at session creation. Now the VALUES travel in a 0600
// file staged over the ControlMaster (content via stdin — no argv anywhere), the remote command
// sources it into the tmux CLIENT's environment and deletes it, and the remote tmux conf's
// `update-environment` list copies the names into the session env at create/attach. Names (never
// values) may additionally ride a `set-option` argv for user-defined custom keys.
//
// The staging write is fire-and-forget from the spawn path (the same seam-injection pattern as
// node-token-service's remote writer: core cannot run ssh, main can). The remote command bridges
// the race with a bounded wait for the file; a file that never lands means the agent launches
// without its env and fails LOUDLY in the pane — fail-open never leaks and never hangs a spawn.
