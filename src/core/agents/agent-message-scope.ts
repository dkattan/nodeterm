/**
 * WHO MAY BE ADDRESSED — the project boundary, resolved off the SERIALIZED store.
 *
 * A message crosses into another agent's session, so the question "is this target mine to write
 * to?" has to be answered before anything else happens, and it has to be answered from a source of
 * truth that covers every project rather than the one that happens to be on screen.
 *
 * ── WHY THE SERIALIZED STORE AND NOT THE LIVE CANVAS ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * React Flow only ever holds the ACTIVE project's nodes (`nodesRef`), while the tmux sessions of
 * every other open project keep running. Resolving a target against `nodesRef` therefore answers
 * "not on the canvas" for every node outside the current tab — the same defect `routeControlSource`
 * exists to fix on the source side, where it surfaced as a lost capability rather than as the wrong
 * canvas answering.
 *
 * Nor is the fix to travel to the target's project, and THIS resolver is what makes that
 * impossible: it takes the projects store and NOTHING else. There is no parameter for a live node
 * list, so there is nothing to travel toward — a guarantee a test can check by running it, since a
 * node the live canvas has but the store has not is refused rather than admitted.
 *
 * `needsLiveCanvas` is a different guarantee and must not be confused with this one: Canvas routes
 * by SOURCE (`routeControlSource(projects, activeId, sourceNodeId)`), so declaring `send`/`reply`
 * store-answered stops a travel to the SENDER's project — the one an off-canvas orchestrator would
 * otherwise trigger on every message it sent. Both matter, for different halves of the pair, and
 * either alone would leave a way for a background agent to yank the human's view and clear an
 * unread badge on the way (G5).
 *
 * ── THREE SURFACES ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * - **Desktop (Electron):** the caller. It passes `useProjects.getState().projects`, the same
 *   serialized array `routeControlSource` and `storedNodeListing` already read.
 * - **Server Edition:** ships, unused — messaging does not exist there (Task 5.3). Pure, with no
 *   electron or main-shell import, so it ships on both shells like everything else in `src/core`.
 * - **Mobile (phone):** never a sender, so it never calls this. A phone-spawned node IS a valid
 *   target and is resolved exactly like any other: it is a node id in a persisted project.
 *
 * ── WHICH WAY IT FAILS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * CLOSED, because the thing being authorised is a write into someone else's terminal. Anything this
 * cannot positively resolve to a single shared project is refused: an id outside `isSafeNodeId`, a
 * source that belongs to no project the store knows, a target that resolves nowhere, a target in a
 * project the store has but the sender does not share. `notPermitted` is not retryable, so a
 * refusal here is terminal — which is correct for a boundary and would be wrong for a timing
 * problem, and none of these are timing problems.
 */

/** The little this needs from a project — a structural subset of both `Project` and the store's
 *  serialized `ProjectFileV1`, so either can be passed without adaptation.
 *
 *  `nodes` is required rather than optional on purpose, and the caller owns that: a synthesised
 *  array with `nodes` absent throws here instead of failing closed. Every real `Project` has it. */

/**
 * Resolve a (source, target) pair to the project they share, or to the refusal that stops it.
 *
 * ── THE ID ITSELF IS CHECKED FIRST, AND NOTHING ELSE ON THIS PATH DOES IT ───────────────────────
 *
 * Node ids come out of `.nodeterm/project.json` and `fileToProject` validates NOTHING — the repo
 * says so at `node-identity-policy.ts:128` and `hook-server.ts:282`. `isSafeNodeId` exists and is
 * applied at `PtyManager.create()`, which is not the load path this resolver reads. Two concrete
 * consequences, and both are why the check is here rather than deeper:
 *
 *  - **The pair limiter's key stops being injective.** Its separator is a NUL, so an id CONTAINING
 *    one collides two different conversations and each throttles the other (`agent-message-flow.ts`
 *    spells out the shape). `isSafeNodeId`'s charset — `[A-Za-z0-9._-]` — is exactly what makes
 *    that impossible.
 *  - **tmux session names FOLD.** `sessionName()` sanitises rather than refuses, so declared ids
 *    `v/1` and `v_1` name ONE session. An id that cannot be sanitised into a different node's
 *    session is the only kind worth admitting.
 *
 * Refused as `unaddressable-node-id`, not as `cross-project`: such an id may be listed in the
 * sender's own project, so the scope word would be a false statement about why it was refused.
 *
 * `self-send` is the same rule, in the same words, that the manual `onConnect` already applies to a
 * canvas edge — a node may not be wired to itself. It is decided before project membership because
 * it is true regardless of where either id lives, including when neither lives anywhere.
 *
 * Note that this is the OUTER guard, not the only one: `decidePreProbe` carries its own self-send
 * backstop so that no future caller can forget this one. Both produce the identical
 * `notPermitted{reason:'self-send'}`, which the test asserts by running them.
 *
 * ── A DUPLICATE NODE ID IS RESOLVED, NOT DISAMBIGUATED ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A duplicate id across two projects (a cloned `project.json` — this repo has shipped that bug
 * once) resolves to the SOURCE's project when the source's project is one of them: the sender
 * addresses the node it can see.
 *
 * That is a routing answer, NOT an isolation guarantee, and the earlier claim here that "the
 * ambiguity never reaches the pane" was false. A session's only key is the bare node id
 * (`PtyManager.byPersistKey`, `paneOwner(persistKey)`, tmux `nt-<nodeId>`); no project id appears
 * anywhere in that namespace and nothing de-duplicates ids when a second project carrying them is
 * opened. So a `project.json` that merely LISTS another project's node id resolves `same-project`
 * here and lands in that node's one global pane — verified by execution, not reasoned about.
 *
 * This resolver cannot close that: the ambiguity is in the session namespace, not in the scope
 * question. What it can do is refuse the ids that make it worse, which is the check above.
 * **PR 5's delivery call must run `isSafeNodeId(targetNodeId)` before `paneOwner`** — a direct
 * caller that skips this resolver gets neither guard.
 *
 * `closed` and `unavailable` projects are deliberately NOT filtered out. A closed project's tmux
 * sessions keep running and are re-adopted on the next start — that is the whole premise of
 * `routeControlSource` — and a delivery goes to a pane, not to a canvas. Filtering them would
 * refuse a perfectly deliverable message on the grounds that a tab is shut.
