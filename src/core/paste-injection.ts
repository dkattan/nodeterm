// Injected prompts (context-link notes, note pushes, slash commands, dictation insert) are

// writes races the receiving TUI's paste heuristics: a composer that treats a rapid unmarked
// burst as a paste can absorb an Enter arriving milliseconds behind it as pasted content
// instead of a submit — observed with Claude Code hosted inside the herdr multiplexer (#47),
// whose input pipeline re-chunks the byte stream. When the target application has REQUESTED
// bracketed-paste mode (tmux tracks this per pane as `bracket_paste_flag`), deliver the
// injection the way paste-aware apps expect: the text framed in paste markers and the Enter
// appended in the SAME write, so the composer sees a definitive paste boundary and the Enter
// can never be re-chunked into the paste. Apps that never requested bracketed paste keep the
// legacy two-step delivery.

/**
 * SECURITY — the payload must not be able to become structure.
 *
 * A frame built as `ESC[200~ + text + ESC[201~` promises the receiving app that everything
 * between the markers is CONTENT. A payload that itself contains `ESC[201~` breaks that promise:
 * the app ends the paste early and reads the rest as raw KEY INPUT — Enter, ctrl-u, ctrl-c, any
 * escape sequence the author chose. That is not only a human pasting a terminal transcript; the
 * canvas-control `write` verb hands an AGENT's text to the same framer, and the confirm dialog a
 * human approves it in renders ESC as nothing at all, so the escape is invisible to the approver.
 * The same shape is live in the herdr multiplexer (`api_helpers.rs`), so treat it as real.
 *
 * The rule is one line and it removes ESC (and its 8-bit C1 equivalent U+009B), not the marker
 * string:
 *
 *  - Removing the literal `ESC[201~` only would leave `ESC[200~` (a second paste-start, which
 *    re-opens or nests the frame in apps that track a boolean) and a payload ending in a bare
 *    `ESC` (which a lenient parser can join with the marker's own ESC that follows it) still
 *    live. All three fall out of the one rule, and no fourth trick has to be enumerated: with
 *    zero ESC bytes in the payload, no byte of it can express paste structure at all.
 *  - It is not lossy the way dropping the marker string is. ESC has no glyph; every printable
 *    character of the payload survives, in order. A pasted transcript that documents bracketed
 *    paste still reads as `[201~` — which is what real terminals do with clipboard content
 *    (xterm's `disallowedPasteControls`, VTE) rather than an invention of ours.
 *  - Splitting and re-framing around the marker was rejected: emitting the literal `ESC[201~`
 *    *outside* a frame is the injection, just performed by us.
 *  - Refusing the write was rejected for the callers that matter: `sendText` answers a boolean,
 *    so a refused note push or dictation insert — the two payloads most likely to carry a real
 *    transcript — would fail silently, and the sequence appears in legitimate text.
 *
 * Applied to the legacy (non-bracketed) delivery too, so `sendText`'s contract does not depend on
 * a runtime probe of the receiver: the same payload must land as content whichever way it is
 * delivered. Nothing nodeterm sends through `sendText` — slash commands, note pushes, dictation
 * transcripts, launch commands, chat messages — carries ESC on purpose, so in practice this
 * changes no byte anyone was sending.
 *
 * NOT in scope, and still open: a payload carrying `\r`/`\n` into a caller that believed it was
 * sending ONE line (`/rename <title>` built from an agent-supplied title). Newlines are legitimate
 * paste CONTENT — the multiline injection the tests pin depends on it — so that belongs at those
 * call sites, not here.
