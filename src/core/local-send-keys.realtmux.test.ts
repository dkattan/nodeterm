// SECURITY — the LOCAL delivery argv, run against a real tmux driving a real bash.
//
// This file proves what the ARGV does to TMUX, which is a different parser from the receiving
// app's and had a different hole: `send-keys -l` does not stop option parsing, so a payload
// beginning with `-` was consumed by tmux as FLAGS.
// Measured on tmux 3.4, every one of `-R  -K  -l  --  -H  -F  -N 3` exits 0 while typing nothing,
// so the delivery reported success — and then sent its Enter anyway, submitting whatever the human
// had already composed in that pane.
//
// `-R` is the worst of them and the reason the harm is not merely "the write was dropped": it
// RESETS THE PANE DISPLAY, so the composed line is wiped from the screen while readline still
// holds it. The human sees an empty prompt; the Enter that follows submits the line they can no
// longer see.
//
// The delivery no longer defends against that class — it cannot reach it. `sendText` hands the
// payload to `tmux load-buffer -` on STDIN, so the text is never an argument of anything and
// there is no option parser between it and the pane. The tests below run the same `-R` payload
// through the CURRENT delivery, and keep the pre-fix argv as a control so "structurally
// impossible" stays a measurement rather than a claim.
//
// A hand-rolled assertion on the argv array cannot see any of this: tmux's option parser is the
// only thing that knows which leading dashes it eats. So tmux is the judge, and a real bash pane
// is the witness for what the Enter did.
